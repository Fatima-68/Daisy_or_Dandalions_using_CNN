🧠 CNN-Based Image Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification tasks. The notebook walks through the steps of loading and preprocessing image data, building a CNN model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

📌 Features
Image loading and normalization

Construction of a simple CNN architecture

Model training with validation

Evaluation using accuracy and loss plots

Confusion matrix visualization for performance insight

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

📂 Project Structure
cnn1.ipynb – Main notebook containing the code for building and training the CNN model.
